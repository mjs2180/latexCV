\begin{resume_section}{Personal Statement}
  \textbf{Why am I seeing that Ad?} That simple question led  me to dive into the world of data analytics, machine learning and  artificial intelligence. We have more capabilities and power to determine the content people see, in real-time, than ever before. The question I was left with was how do we do it ethically and securely. I'm passionate about data, machine learning and the algorithms that only now are we able to fully realise.
